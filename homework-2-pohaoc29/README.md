# Hw2 - Combined Cycle Power Plant Data Set - Regression Models
### Introduction
Using regression models on Combined Cycle Power Plant Data Set to analyze, visualize data and predict
Models: simple linear regression, multiple regression, KNN regression model


### Data description
Combined Cycle Power Plant Data Set (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Combined+Cycle+Power+Plant)

The dataset contains data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to work with full load. Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the plant.
