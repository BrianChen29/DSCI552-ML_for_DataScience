Course work in USC DSCI552 Machine Learning for Data Science

### 1. Using KNN classification on Vertebral Column Data Set to do analysis on patient classification
Each patient in the data set is represented in the data set by six biomechanical attributes derived from the shape and orientation of the pelvis and lumbar spine. Using these features to do patient classification.

### 2. Using regression models Combined Cycle Power Plant Data Set to analyze and predict
linear, multiple, KNN regression models

### 3. Time Series Classification (Part1): Feature creation and extraction
### 4. Time Series Classification (Part2): Binary and Multi-class classification
  - Binary classification using logistic regression
  - Binary classification using L1-penalized logistic regression
  - Multi-class classification (The realistic case) using L1-penalized multinomial regression model and a Naïve Bayes’ classifier

### 5. Accute Inflamations data & Communities and Crime data
  - Decision Trees as interpretable models
  - Using linear model, ridge regression model, LASSO model, and PCR model
  - Using L1-penalized gradient boosting tree (XGBoost)

### 6. APS Failure data
  - Using random forest to classify the data set
  - L1-penalized logistic model trees (XGBoost)
  - Using SMOTE(Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to pre-process the data and fit the processed data into L1-penalized logistic regression at each node(same as above one)

### 7. Anuran Calls (MFCCs) Data Set - Multi-class and Multi-Label Classification
  - Using Support Vector Machines
  - Using K-Means Clustering - Monte-Carlo Simulation
