### Data description
#### Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic)

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.  They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The data set has IDs, classes (Benign=B, Malignant=M), and 30 attributes. This data has two output classes.

#### banknote authentication Data Set (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/267/banknote+authentication)

Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens.  For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. The final images have 400x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi were gained. Wavelet Transform tool were used to extract features from images. The data set has 5 variables: 
1. variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous),
2. skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
3. curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
4. entropy of image (continuous)
5. class (integer)
